            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Chicken Katsu</strong> is a Japanese dish consisting of a breaded and deep-fried chicken cutlet. Typically made with boneless chicken breast or thigh, it's coated in flour, dipped in egg, and covered in <strong>panko breadcrumbs</strong> before being fried to a golden crisp. The result is a crunchy, juicy cutlet often served sliced and accompanied by a tangy-sweet <strong>tonkatsu sauce</strong>, shredded cabbage, and steamed rice. Chicken katsu is popular in Japanese home cooking, bento boxes, and casual restaurants.
